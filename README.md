## Description


A React portfolio is a personalized website or web application built using the React JavaScript library, designed to display a web developer's skills, projects, and experiences. It acts as a digital resume and portfolio, offering a comprehensive overview of the developer's expertise and showcasing their past work through interactive project presentations. With responsive design and user-friendly navigation, it serves as a powerful tool for networking, job hunting, and impressing potential clients or employers in the web development industry.

Afterwards, go to VSCode and open the local terminal from the desired parent repostory where you desire to install the React-Portfolio. Then, write 'git clone (paste link here)'. Finally, you'll notice the repository has been installed for your convenience. Also, download the proper dependencies (npm i). Lastly, for the app to start compiling and the server to run, write on the terminal "npm run start" and if successful, you'll be able to run the app on localhost:3000 on your browser. Before making any changes, make sure that the propper dependencies have been downloaded to prevent bugs or functionality issues.



## Usage
